## Introduction

This is a demo project for learning backend development using NodeJs, Typescript and Express. The project
will cover the basics of setting up a project, creating routes, handling requests and responses, error
handling, database integration, API documentation, testing and deployment.

## Getting Started

To get started, you need to have NodeJs and npm installed on your machine. You can download
NodeJs from the official website.

## Project Structure

The project structure will be as follows:

## Setting up the Project

To set up the project, you need to create a new project folder and navigate to it in your
terminal. Then, you can run the following command to create a new NodeJs project:
bash
npm init -y
This will create a new `package.json` file in your project folder.

## Creating Routes

To create routes, you need to create a new file called `routes.ts` in the `src
folder. In this file, you can define the routes for your application.

## Handling Requests and Responses

To handle requests and responses, you need to create a new file called `controllers.ts` in the
`src` folder. In this file, you can define the controllers for your application.

## Error Handling

To handle errors, you need to create a new file called `errors.ts` in the `src`
folder. In this file, you can define the error handlers for your application.

## Database Integration

To integrate a database, you need to install a database driver and create a new file called
`database.ts` in the `src` folder. In this file, you can define the database
connection and queries.

## API Documentation

To document your API, you need to install a documentation tool and create a new file called
`docs.ts` in the `src` folder. In this file, you can define the API
documentation.

## Testing

To test your application, you need to install a testing framework and create a new file called
`tests.ts` in the `src` folder. In this file, you can define the tests
for your application.

## Deployment

To deploy your application, you need to create a new file called `deploy.ts` in the `src` folder. In this file, you can define the deployment configuration.

## Conclusion

In this project, we have covered the basics of setting up a project, creating routes, handling requests
and responses, error handling, database integration, API documentation, testing and deployment.

## Code

Nodejs
Express
Typescript
MongoDB

## Commit Message Guidelines

- Use the imperative mood (e.g. "Add feature" instead of "Added feature")
- Keep the first line short (less than 50 characters)
- Use bullet points for multiple changes
- Use the format "type: description" for commit messages
